	Version: version,
	Short:   "Manage and automatically set git user profiles",
	Long: `git-profile is a simple CLI to manage and automatically set git user profiles based on the project's origin.

Save a profile together with its origin and let git-profile set the attributes next time you clone a new repository.
To make managing names and emails more convenient in general, git-profile offers further commands that will let you
check, unset and set credentials without creating a profile. You also get the option to do these things globally.

Common commands:
  git-profile init      - Automatically set credentials based on repository origin
  git-profile add       - Add a new profile
  git-profile list      - List all profiles
  git-profile update    - Update one or multiple existing profiles
  git-profile rm        - Remove a profile
  git-profile set       - Manually set a profile
  git-profile unset     - Unset git config
  git-profile check     - Check current credentials
`,
}
